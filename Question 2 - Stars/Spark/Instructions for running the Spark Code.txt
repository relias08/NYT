Instructions for running the Spark Code

If we were dealing with big data, the input file could have had billions of rows and petabytes in size and stored across a cluster of computers ie. in a distributed file storage system like HDFS or a NoSQL database like MongoDB or Cassandra

In this example we are using an input file (ie. hygdata_v3.csv) that is stored in the local file system. So first make sure that 'hygdata_v3.csv' is

$ spark-submit kstars.py 10
