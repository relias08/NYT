Question 3 and Question 4 would be more in line for someone specialized as an AWS Solutions Architect or Network Administrator.

My expertise is in the area of big data engineering and analytics.
The job description I received indicates requirement for skills to modernize systems for ingesting, storing and processing big data.
I do have the skills that meet these requirements such as:

- Ingest and process big data from multiple sources (including streaming data using technologies such as Kafka, Sqoop, Flume, etc.)
  eg. from Oracle/PostreSQL/Streaming data sources into HDFS/MongoDB/Cassandra/HBase
- Store data of unlimited size in a scalable and fault tolerant manner in distributed file storage systems such as NoSQL databases, HDFS, etc.
- Work with cloud computing platforms and Spark Clusters in the cloud eg. using AWS EMR, Hortonworks or Cloudera 
- Data Transformation using Spark (ie. feature engineering, creating derived variables, etc. for Report generating programs and 
  Machine Learing algorithms)
- Machine Learning and Predictive Modelling using Spark
- Graphical representation and creating dashboards with the results (eg. using Tableau) 

If the position requires any of the above skills I would be extremely interested.
